//! # Bounty Escrow — Event Definitions
//!
//! All events emitted by [`BountyEscrowContract`] conform to **EVENT_VERSION_V2**,
//! the canonical Grainlify event envelope.
//!
//! ## EVENT_VERSION_V2 Contract
//!
//! Every event payload carries a `version: u32` field set to the
//! [`EVENT_VERSION_V2`] constant (`2`).  The **first** topic slot is always a
//! domain `Symbol` that names the event category; the second topic (where
//! present) is the `bounty_id` so indexers can filter by both category *and*
//! bounty without decoding the payload.
//!
//! ```text
//! topics : (category_symbol [, bounty_id: u64])
//! data   : <EventStruct>   ← always carries version: u32 = 2
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why topic-level versioning?
//!
//! Soroban events are permanently archived.  Placing the version in the payload
//! (rather than a topic) would force indexers to decode every event body just to
//! determine whether the schema is relevant.  Placing it in `topics[0]` allows
//! cheap prefix-filter queries at the RPC/Horizon layer.
//!
//! ## Security invariants
//!
//! * Events are emitted **after** all state mutations and token transfers
//!   (Checks-Effects-Interactions ordering) so they accurately reflect final
//!   on-chain state.
//! * No PII, KYC data, or private keys are ever emitted.
//! * All `symbol_short!` strings are ≤ 8 bytes — Soroban silently truncates
//!   longer strings, which would corrupt topic-based filtering.
